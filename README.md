# Gam

This game is designed to be a combination of bopit and Cookie Clicker for the Rasberry Pi
At first there are physical buttons to click based on the colors of lights. As the game progresses,
you will be able to interact with a CLI. This might tempt you to write a script rather than
click and type by hand. But be warned, if you make errors in your responses, there will be 
no Proof of Fun, and you will lose points.
